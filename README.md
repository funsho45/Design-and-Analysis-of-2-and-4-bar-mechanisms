# What is this?

A constrained rigid body system, in which one of the bodies is in the frame is referred to as a mechanism. When considering a constrained rigid body system, the degrees of freedom of that mechanism is important. 

For this project the simulation and analysis of a hypathtical two-bar linked planar manipulator which welds a structure in a production line was carried out. Also a four-bar link planar mechanism thats would be driven by an electric motor was also simulated analyed.

# Method

MATLAB software will be used to create a simulation of both these link bar mechanisms, with defining variables, such as the velocity, length, mass and inertia. For theoretical calculations, MATLAB is a popular software when it comes to the analysis of experimental data. The mechanisms will also be modelled in Siemens NX, which a motion simulation will then be carried out to produce graphical results which will be compared against results produced in MATLAB.

## Two bar link mechanism

The two-bar link planar manipulator shown in **Figure 1**, consists of link OA, which is fixated to the point of and to the link AB at point A. To ensure that point B travels in a straight-line path in the XY coordinates, from (0.3m,0.0m) to (0.0m,0.3m) with a constant velocity of 2 m/s, the angles ùúÉ1 and ùúÉ2 will be controlled.

### Mathematical modelling of Two bar link

Before carrying out the simulation, a mathematical model of the system needs to be developed.
The parameters given of the two-bar link system are the following:

r1 = 0.3m

r2 = 0.2m

Velocity at point B = 2 m/s

Where:

r1= Link OA length 

r2= Link AB length

A mathematical analysis will be performed to obtain equations that describe the system.

By squaring and adding up both sides of the equations the mechanisms position can be found:

The angular velocity can now be calculated using both **Equation 1** and **Equation 2** from above differentiating with respect to time:

## Four bar link mechanism  

The four-bar link mechanism shown **Figure 7** in consists of three links, link *AB, BC, CD* and *DA* which represents the ground. Link *AB* is driven by a motor with the torque force Tm starting the movement in the mechanism, *CD* then carries the load torque Tl. A counter-clockwise direction is taken in a horizontal axis to calculate the angles.

### Mathematical modelling of Four-bar link

Before carrying out the simulation, a mathematical model of the system needs to be developed.

The parameters given of the four-bar link system are the following:

**Figure 15** shows the four-bar linked mechanism assembled and an emotion simulation. The joints parameters featured for each link have the appropriate features such as the revolute and the slider. Link AD simulated to be the ground and is set in an always stationary position. Link AB is the moving force and the mechanism and rotates counterclockwise at an angular velocity of 100 rads/s.

**Figure 16**: Variation of link orientations

**Figure 16** above shows variation of link orientation with the angle‚Äôs theta 1 and theta 2. It is seen that both angles are positive, as they rotate along the excesses in an anticlockwise direction. Theta one begins above -50 degrees and increases to an angle of approximately 50 degrees indicating a continuous upward direction. Theta two, on the other hand, starts in a positive position and begins to increase to points beyond 150 degrees steadily.

**Figure 17**: Variation of angular velocity

**Figure 17** shows the variation of angular velocity for the 21. It is shown that the mega one begins a lower place than omega one at around 1 rad/sec, with omega two starting above 10 rad/sec. An increase in velocity is noticed in the second angle when in comparison to the first this is due to rapid acceleration. The first angular velocity has lower peak point in the second angular velocity, but the second angular velocity sees a sharp decrease of this peak is reached when compared to the first angular velocity.

**Figure 21**: Polar load diagram for joint D

**Figure 18-Figure 21** shows the polar loads of joints *A, B, C and D* and is the result of the dynamic analysis of all the forces. It is apparent that **Figure 18** and  **Figure 19** a very similar in creating perhaps most joints having the same magnitude while moving with the constant velocity. The same can be said for joints *C* and *D*.

**Figure 22**:Variation of motor torque

**Figure 22** above shows the variation when a torque is applied to joints *A* and *B*(see **Figure 8**).At each cycle of the mechanism there is an increase in the torque of the motor and the angular velocity is constant. As the link moves energy is stored in the link and when the energy generated from the torque of the motor is zero, the energy stored in the link returns to the motor and vice versa. This explains the fluctuation of the peaks shown for the torque above.

**Figure 23**: Variation of angular velocity

**Figure 23** shows the variation of the link angular velocity, and when compared to the results produced from the MATLAB plot, the results are the same except the that the angular velocity values are positive due to NX not providing negative values.

**Figure 24-Figure 26** show a close resemblance to Figure 19-Figure 21, but the magnitudes shifted slightly indicating an orientation or fault during the NX modelling process.

# Thoughts

The simpler of the two methods was the modelling method using MATLAB. After creating the parts in NX and assembling it to create both the two bar and the four-bar mechanisms, setting up the joint parameters was fairly simple, but problems occurred during the orientation of the assembly during the motion simulation process this resulted in graphs that was similar compared to the MATLAB counterpart but was not correct.
To conclude both methods (MATLAB and NX) were valuable for carrying out the dynamics and kinematic analysis of a mechanism.
